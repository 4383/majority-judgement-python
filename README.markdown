# Majority Judgement

This is a python implementation of the majority judgement voting procedure, as
proposed by Michel Balinski and Rida Laraki in [A theory of measuring, electing
, and ranking](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/21/8720.full).

It takes tallies of grades provided by voters and provides a python type to 
wrap them which is ordered according to the majority judgement order. See the
documentation in the code for more details.
